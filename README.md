# Financial Data Analysis for GFC AI chatbot

## Data Extraction
### Extracted data of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple (10-k Annual Data) from https://www.sec.gov/ 
### Preparing and preprocessing data is crucial for the successful application of AI in finance. It ensures that the data fed into AI models is clean, consistent, and structured in a way that maximizes the model's ability to learn and make accurate predictions or provide valuable insights. This stage is not just about technical execution but also understanding the financial context and relevance of the data being processed.

### Key sections to focus on for financial data extraction:
### Income statement: This section provides information about the company's revenue, costs, and expenses over a specific period of time.
#### Key data points: Total revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, and net income.
#### Extraction technique: Look for the income statement summary, typically in the early pages of the reports. Pay attention to year-over-year changes.

### Balance sheet: This section outlines the company’s assets, liabilities, and the shareholders’ equity at a specific point in time.
#### Key data points: Current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities, long-term liabilities, and total shareholders’ equity.
#### Extraction technique: Focus on the balance sheet summary. Compare assets against liabilities to understand the company’s financial health and note any large changes in assets or liabilities.

### Cash flow statement: This shows how changes to the balance sheet and income impact cash and cash equivalents.
#### Key data points: Cash from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
#### Extraction technique: Analyze the cash flow statement to understand how the company generates and spends its cash. This can provide insights into a company's liquidity.

### Preparing and preprocessing data for AI-driven applications
#### Data cleaning: Involves correcting or removing incorrect, corrupted, or duplicate data. Techniques include filling in missing values, smoothing noisy data, and resolving inconsistencies.
#### Data transformation: This step is about normalizing and standardizing data to ensure it's in a usable format for AI models. Includes converting all financial figures to a consistent format (e.g., all figures in thousands or millions) and adjusting for inflation or currency changes where necessary.

#### Preprocessing for AI models:
#### Feature engineering: The process of using domain knowledge to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. In financial data, this might involve creating ratios or deriving financial health indicators from raw data.
#### Data encoding and formatting: Many AI models require data in a specific format. This may involve encoding categorical data (like fiscal quarters) into numerical values or restructuring data sets for time-series analysis.
#### Dealing with time-series data: Financial data often involves time-series analysis. Special care should be taken to handle trends and seasonality and potentially integrate lag features that capture past values.

## Developing an AI-powered financial chatbot
### Rule-based logic: Start by implementing rule-based responses. This means your chatbot will use predetermined responses to specific queries. Think of it as a sophisticated "if-then" logic: if the user asks "X," then the chatbot responds with "Y." This approach is ideal for handling frequently asked questions about financial data.

### State management: Even in a simple chatbot, managing the conversation's state is important. This involves remembering the context of the conversation or the user's previous queries to make responses more relevant and personalized.

### Error handling: Prepare your chatbot to handle unrecognized queries gracefully. It should inform users when it doesn't understand a question and guide them towards queries that it can respond to.

### Natural language processing (NLP) experts: Colleagues specializing in NLP are working to refine the chatbot's ability to parse and understand the nuances of human language, enabling it to interact more naturally with users.

### Machine learning engineers: This segment of the team is dedicated to incorporating machine learning algorithms that allow the chatbot to learn from interactions, improve its responses over time, and handle more complex queries beyond the rule-based scope.

### Data integration specialists: These are team members focused on the seamless integration of financial data, ensuring the chatbot has real-time access to accurate and comprehensive financial information.

### User experience (UX) designers: UX designers are ensuring that interactions with the chatbot are intuitive and user-friendly, designing interfaces that make financial insights accessible to all users, regardless of their financial expertise.
